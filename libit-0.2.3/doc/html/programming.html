>      libit is a C library for information theory and signal processing.
      It extends the C language with vector, matrix, complex and function
      types, and provides some common source coding, channel coding and 
      signal processing tools.
  </P
><P
>      The goal of libit is to provide easy to use yet efficient tools, and is
      mainly targeted at researchers and developpers in the fields of 
      Communication and Compression. The syntax is purposedly close to that of
      other tools commonly used in these fields, such as MATLAB, octave,
      or IT++. Therefore, experiments and applications can be developped,
      ported and modified simply, without requiring deep knowledge of the
      C language. Additional goals of the library include portability to
      many platforms and architecture, and ease of installation.
  </P
><P
>      Rather than trying to provide the very latest state-of-the-art techniques
      or a large panel of specific methods, this library aims at providing the
      most general and commonly used tools to build a communication chain,
      from signal processing and source coding to channel coding and
      transmission.
  </P
><P
>      Among these tools are some common source and channel models, modulation
      and quantization techniques, wavelet analysis, entropy coding, etc...
      As examples and to ensure the correctness of the algorithms with respect
      to published results, some test programs are also provided.
  </P
><P
>      All examples provided herein are small code snippets used to illustrate the document. They may not compile and run successfully.
  </P
><P
>      As the library is still under heavy development, it is only partially documented currently.
