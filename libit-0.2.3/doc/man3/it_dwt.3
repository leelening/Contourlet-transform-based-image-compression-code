.SH NAME
it_dwt \- discrete wavelet transform
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/wavelet.h>
.sp
vec it_dwt ( vec v, it_wavelet_lifting_t const *lifting, int levels
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function computes the \fIlevels\fR-level discrete wavelet transform of \fIv\fR using the lifting steps described by \fIlifting\fR\&. Currently the lifting steps for the usual 5/3 and 9/7 biorthogonal filters are predefined as "it_wavelet_lifting_53" and "it_wavelet_lifting_97", although you can provide your own lifting steps.
This transform is critically sampled, therefore the output vector of coefficients has the same size as the input vector \fIv\fR\&.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The set of wavelet coefficients
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <wavelet.h>

\&...

/* analyse a signal 'v' using a 5-level 9/7 wavelet decomposition */
vec vt = it_dwt(v, it_wavelet_lifting_97, 5);

/* clear the high subband */
vec_set_between(vt, (vec_length(v) + 1) / 2, end, 0);

/* recompose the vector by inverse transform */
vec vr = it_idwt(vt, it_wavelet_lifting_97, 5);
