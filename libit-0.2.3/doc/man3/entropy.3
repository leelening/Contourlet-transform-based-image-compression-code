.SH NAME
entropy \- first-order entropy rate of a discrete source
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fB#include <it/source_func.h>
.sp
double entropy ( vec pdf
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function returns the entropy rate, i.e. the minimum achievable average description length of a discrete first-order source described by \fIpdf\fR\&. This vector gives the probability of each symbol.
