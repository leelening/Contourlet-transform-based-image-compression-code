The function \fBis_valid_markov_matrix\fR verifies that a matrix \fIpt\fR is a valid markov matrix. In order to be a matrix defining a valid Markov chain, a matrix must be so that all the elements must stands between 0 and 1 and so that the sum of each column must be equal to 1. The value of 1 must be achieved with an tolerance (interval of error) lower than the parameter \fItol\fR\&.
