cvec_geom \- set the vector to a geometric sequence
.SH SYNOPSIS

.sp
void cvec_geom ( cvec, cplx start, cplx r
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBcvec_geom\fR sets the vector \fIv\fR so that the elements correspond to the geometric sequence 
of starting value \fIstart\fR, generated by the complex geometric factor \fIr\fR\&. The length is kept unchanged.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
None
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <vec.h>

\&...

cvec v = cvec_new(5);  /* creates the vector (not initialized) */
cvec_geom(v,1,i);      /* set v to [1 i -1 -i 1]             */
cvec_delete(v);        /* free the vector                      */
