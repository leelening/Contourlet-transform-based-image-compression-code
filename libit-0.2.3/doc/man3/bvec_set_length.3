.SH NAME
bvec_set_length \- Modify the length of a vector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/vec.h>
.sp
void bvec_set_length ( bvec v, size_t N
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBbvec_set_length\fR macro modifies the length of the vector \fIv\fR so that it is equal to \fIN\fR\&.  
If the length increases, the additional elements are not initialized. 
If the amount of memory allocated to the vector is not sufficient, then the function \fBbvec_set_length_max\fR is automatically called to allow the size modification. For this reason, the pointer corresponding to the vector may be modified.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
None
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <vec.h>

\&...

bvec v = bvec_new(10);  /* allocate a new vector of size 10 */
bvec_set_length(v,4);   /* reduce the size of the vector    */
bvec_set_length(v,12);  /* increases the size of the vector */
v[10] = 1;
v[11] = 4;
bvec_delete(v);                        /* free the vector */
