.SH NAME
source_estim_GG_from_histo \- estimate the parameters of a generalized Gaussian
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/source_fit.h>
.sp
void source_estim_GG_from_histo ( vec pdf, vec symbols, double * alpha, double * beta
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function estimates the parameters of a generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance between the estimated GGD and the histogram \fIpdf\fR\&. The values associated to each symbol of the alphabet are given in \fIsymbols\fR\&. Therefore, \fIsymbols\fR has the same size as \fIpdf\fR, which must sum to one. The estimated alpha and beta parameters of the GGD are returned at the address pointed by the \fIalpha\fR and \fIbeta\fR arguments. These arguments are also used as the initial GGD parameters for the minimization.
.PP
The generalized Gaussian distribution is defined as GGD(x) = exp(-(|x| / \fIalpha\fR)**\fIbeta\fR).
