.SH NAME
cvec_new_arithm \- create an arithmetic sequence
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/vec.h>
.sp
cvec cvec_new_arithm ( cplx start, cplx incr, size_t N
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBcvec_new_arithm\fR creates a vector generated so that the elements correspond to the arithmetic sequence of starting value \fIstart\fR, increasing by a step of \fIincr\fR and of length \fIN\fR\&.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The new vector
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <vec.h>

\&...

cvec v = cvec_new_arithm(0,cplx_I,4); /* creates the vector [0 i 2i 3i] */
cvec_delete(v);                       /* free the vector                */
