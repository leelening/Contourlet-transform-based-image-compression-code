The function \fBmat_wav_read\fR reads a WAV file named \fIfilename\fR and returns a matrix of doubles. Each row of this matrix corresponds to a channel in the WAV file. For example, a mono WAV file will result in a matrix with one row, whereas a stereo WAV file will result in a matrix with two rows. Each row is a vector representing the samples of the sound for each instant. The range used to represent each sample and sampling frequency depend on the actual WAV file and can be retrieved via \fBwav_info\fR\&.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"

The matrix containing a row per channel
