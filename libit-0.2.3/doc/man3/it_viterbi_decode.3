.SH NAME
it_viterbi_decode \- Viterbi decoding of convolutional codes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/convcode.h>
.sp
bvec it_viterbi_decode ( it_convolutional_code_t *code, mat metrics
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function returns the maximum a posteriori (MAP) sequence maximizing the total metric among all possible paths in the trellis of the convolution code \fIcode\fR\&. The branch metrics of this trellis are given in the \fImetrics\fR matrix, where each row in 0..2^n-1 corresponds to a branch label and each column corresponds to an index in the received sequence, for a code of rate k:n. The metric m[i][j] corresponds to the logarithm of the probability of observing the set of n bits represented by i at time j. These metrics are dependent on the modulation and channel used for transmission.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The decoded sequence
