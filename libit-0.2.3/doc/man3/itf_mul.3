.SH NAME
itf_mul \- multiplication operator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/math.h>
.sp
double itf_mul ( double x, it_function_args(itf_sum) *args
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBitf_mul\fR defines the product of two it_function_t. The product of the functions is obtained by computing the value of each function at position \fIx\fR and returning their product. The product operator has the following parameters, passed through the \fIargs\fR argument.
.SS "FUNCTION PARAMETERS"
.TP
\fBf\fR
The first function to multiply.
.TP
\fBf_args\fR
The parameters of the first function to multiply.
.TP
\fBg\fR
The second function to multiply.
.TP
\fBg_args\fR
The parameters of the second function to multiply.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The product for a given value 'x'
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <math.h>

\&...

/* declare the integration parameters */
it_function_args(itf_mul) mul_args;
/* multiply the identity function with itself */
mul_args.f = itf_identity;
mul_args.f_args = NULL;
mul_args.g = itf_identity;
mul_args.g_args = NULL;
/* compute the value of the product in 1.0 */
itf_mul(1.0, &mul_args);
