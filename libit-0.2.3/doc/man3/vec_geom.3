.sp
void vec_geom ( vec v, double start, double r
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBvec_geom\fR sets the vector \fIv\fR so that the elements correspond to the geometric sequence 
of starting value \fIstart\fR, generated by the geometric factor \fIr\fR\&. The length is kept unchanged.

None
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <vec.h>

\&...

vec v = vec_new(5);  /* creates the vector (not initialized) */
vec_geom(v,1.5,2);   /* set v to [1.5 3 6 12 24]             */
vec_delete(v);       /* free the vector                      */
