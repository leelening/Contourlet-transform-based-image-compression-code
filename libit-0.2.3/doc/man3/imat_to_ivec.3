.SH NAME
imat_to_ivec \- vectorize a matrix into a vector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/mat.h>
.sp
ivec imat_to_ivec ( imat m
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBimat_to_ivec\fR vectorizes the matrix \fIm\fR into a vector. In other terms, the resulting vector is the concatenation of all the rows of \fIm\fR\&. Its length is then the product of the width by the height of the matrix 'm '. Note that this function is the equivalent of the notation 'm(:)' in Matlab.

ivec v = imat_to_ivec (m);                   /* v = [1 2 4 3] */
