.SH NAME
vec_to_mat \- convert a vector into a matrix
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/mat.h>
.sp
mat vec_to_mat ( vec v, size_t width
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBvec_to_mat\fR constructs a matrix from a vector \fIv\fR\&. The \fIwidth\fR first elements of the vector form the first row, the \fIwidth\fR next the second  row, and so on. Note that the length of the vector \fIv\fR should be a multiple of \fIwidth\fR\&.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The matrix
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <mat.h>

\&...

vec v = vec_new_arithm (1, 2, 12); /* v = [1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23] */
  
mat m = vec_to_mat (v, 4);        /* m = [[ 1  3  5  7]
                                          [ 9 11 13 15]
