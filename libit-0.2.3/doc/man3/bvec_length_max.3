.SH NAME
bvec_length_max \- get the number of elements allocated to a vector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/vec.h>
.sp
int bvec_length_max ( bvec v
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBbvec_length\fR returns the maximum length of the vector \fIv\fR\&. By maximum length, it does not mean that the vector can't grow. It just means the length to which the vector can grow without a call (implicit or explicit) to function \fBbvec_set_length_mat\fR\&.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The maximum length
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <vec.h>

\&...

bvec v  = bvec_new_alloc (1,3);
v[0]   = 3;                      /* v = [3]   */
int l  = bvec_length (v);        /* l = 1     */
int l  = bvec_length_max(v);     /* l = 3     */

bvec_push (v, 2);                /* v = [3 2], and there is not re-allocation */
