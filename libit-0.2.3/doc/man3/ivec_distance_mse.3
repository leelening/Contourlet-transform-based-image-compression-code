.SH NAME
ivec_distance_mse \- mean square error between two sequences
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/distance.h>
.sp
double ivec_distance_mse ( ivec v1, ivec v2, double rec_value
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function computes the mean square error (MSE) between two sequences \fIv1\fR and  \fIv2\fR\&. This error is defined as the average of the square of the difference between each element of \fIv1\fR and the corresponding element of \fIv2\fR\&. If the vectors are not of the same length, the shortest vector is padded with the value \fIrec_value\fR from its end up to the length of the longest vector before computing the MSE.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The mean square error
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <distance.h>

\&...

ivec v1 = ivec_new_string("0 1 0 3");
ivec v2 = ivec_new_string("1 5 4 6");
/* compute the MSE between v1 and v2 */
double mse = ivec_distance_mse(v1, v2, 0);
