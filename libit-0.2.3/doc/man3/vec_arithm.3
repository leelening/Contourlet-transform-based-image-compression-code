);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBvec_arithm\fR sets the vector \fIv\fR so that the elements correspond to the arithmetic sequence of starting value \fIstart\fR, increasing by a step of \fIincr\fR\&. The length is kept unchanged.

.nf

#include <vec.h>

\&...

vec v = vec_new(5);    /* creates the vector (not initialized) */
vec_arithm(v,5,-2.5);  /* set v to [5 2.5 0 -2.5 -5]           */
vec_delete(v);         /* free the vector                      */
