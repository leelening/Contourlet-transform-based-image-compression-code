);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBcvec_sum_between\fR returns the sum of the elements of the vector \fIv\fR whose position stands in the interval [\fIi1\fR,\fIi2\fR]. The keyword end may be used for the parameter \fIi2\fR\&. In that case it means that the summation must be proceeded from position \fIi1\fR to the end of the vector.

.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <vec.h>

\&...

cvec v = cvec_new_string( "i 1-2i 2.5 0 -i" ); /* Create a vector of 5 elements */
cplx s = cvec_sum_between( v, 2, end );        /* s = 2.5-i                     */
