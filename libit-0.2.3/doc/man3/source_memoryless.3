.SH NAME
source_memoryless \- generic dicrete source generator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/source.h>
.sp
ivec source_memoryless ( size_t size, vec pdf
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function generates a random discrete vector of length \fIsize\fR where each sample is drawn from the distribution \fIpdf\fR\&. The length of the \fIpdf\fR vector gives the cardinality of the source alphabet, with each element representing the probability of the corresponding symbol. Therefore, the sum of the \fIpdf\fR vector must be equal to one.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <source.h>

\&...

vec pdf = vec_new_string("0.5 0.3 0.1 0.1"); /* probability density function */
S = source_memoryless(20, pdf );
