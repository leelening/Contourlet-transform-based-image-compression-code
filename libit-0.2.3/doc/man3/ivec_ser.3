.SH NAME
ivec_ser \- symbol error rate between two sequences
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/distance.h>
.sp
double ivec_ser ( ivec v1, ivec v2
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function computes the symbol error rate (SER) between two sequences \fIv1\fR and \fIv2\fR\&. This corresponds to the Hamming distance between \fIv1\fR and \fIv2\fR divided by the length of \fIv1\fR, which is taken as the reference in case the vectors lengths do not match. 
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The symbol Error Rate
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <distance.h>

\&...

ivec v1 = ivec_new_string("1 5 6 6 4");
ivec v2 = ivec_new_string("2 4 5 6 7");
/* compute the SER between v1 and v2 */
double ser = ivec_ser(v1, v2);
