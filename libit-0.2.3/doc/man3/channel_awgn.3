.SH NAME
channel_awgn \- AWGN channel simulation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/channel.h>
.sp
vec channel_awgn ( vec v, double sigma
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function simulates the transmission of a vector over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. An independent Gaussian noise of standard deviation \fIsigma\fR is added to the vector \fIv\fR\&.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The noisy signal
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <channel.h>

\&...

vec message = vec_new_string("-1 1 1 1 -1 -1 1");

/* send over an AWGN channel of standard deviation 0.5 */ 
vec received = channel_awgn(message, 0.5);
