.SH NAME
entropy_bin \- first-order entropy rate of a binary source
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/source_func.h>
.sp
double entropy_bin ( double p0
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function returns the entropy rate, i.e. the minimum achievable average description length of a binary first-order source described by \fIp0\fR\&. This value is the probability of the \fI0\fR symbol.   
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <source_func.h>

\&...

double p0 = 0.1; /* a binary source with mostly '1' */
double H = entropy_bin(p0);
