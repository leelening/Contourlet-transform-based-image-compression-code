.SH NAME
mat_distance_mse \- mean square error between two images
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/distance.h>
.sp
double mat_distance_mse ( mat v1, mat v2, double rec_value
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function computes the mean square error (MSE) between two matrices \fIm1\fR and  \fIm2\fR\&. This error is defined as the average of the square of the difference between each element of \fIv1\fR and the corresponding element of \fIv2\fR\&. If the matrices are not of the same size, the missing elements are assumed to be equal to the value \fIrec_value\fR when computing the MSE.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The mean square error
.SH "EXAMPLE"

mat m1 = mat_new(2,2);
mat m2 = mat_new(2,2);

/* compute the MSE between v1 and v2 */
double mse = mat_distance_mse(v1, v2, 0);
