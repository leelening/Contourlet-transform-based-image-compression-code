.SH NAME
itf_compose \- function composition
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/math.h>
.sp
double itf_compose ( double x, it_function_args(itf_compose) *args
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBitf_compose\fR defines the composition of two it_function_t. The composition of the functions is obtained by computing the value of the function \fBg\fR at position \fIx\fR and the value of the function \fBf\fR at the position \fIg(x)\fR\&. The composition operator has the following parameters, passed through the \fIargs\fR argument.
.SS "FUNCTION PARAMETERS"
.TP
\fBf\fR
The function called last.
.TP
\fBf_args\fR
The  parameters of the function called last.
.TP
\fBg\fR
The function called first.
.TP
\fBg_args\fR
The parameters of the function called first.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The value of the composed function for a given 'x'
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <math.h>

\&...

/* declare the integration parameters */
it_function_args(itf_compose) compose_args;
/* compose the identity function with itself */
compose_args.f = itf_identity;
compose_args.f_args = NULL;
compose_args.g = itf_identity;
compose_args.g_args = NULL;
/* compute the value of the composition in 1.0 */
itf_compose(1.0, &compose_args);
