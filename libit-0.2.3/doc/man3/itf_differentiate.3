.SH NAME
itf_differentiate \- differentiation operator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/math.h>
.sp
double itf_differentiate ( double x, it_function_args(itf_differentiate) *args
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBitf_differentiate\fR defines the differentiate of an it_function_t. The differentiate of the function is approximated by computing the value of the function at \fIx\fR+delta and \fIx\fR-delta, and computing the difference divided by two delta. In the current implementation, delta is set to 1e-5, leading to an error in O(1e-10). The differentiation operator has the following parameters, passed through the \fIargs\fR argument.
.SS "FUNCTION PARAMETERS"
.TP
\fBfunction\fR
The function to differentiate.
.TP
\fBargs\fR
The parameters of the function to differentiate.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The differentiate of the function for a given 'x'
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <math.h>

\&...

/* declare the differentiation parameters */
it_function_args(itf_differentiate) differentiate_args;

/* differentiate the identity function */
differentiate_args.function = itf_identity;
differentiate_args.args = NULL;

/* compute the value of the differentiate at 1.0 */
itf_differentiate(1.0, &differentiate_args);
