.SH NAME
it_wavelet2D_split \- split the matrix of wavelet coefficients
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/wavelet2D.h>
.sp
mat * it_wavelet2D_split ( mat wav, int nb_levels
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function splits the matrix of wavelet coefficients \fIwav\fR to a set of subband matrices. The number of levels \fInb_level\fR must be given. The returned array of matrices is an array of \fInb_level\fR+1 matrices with the first matrix representing the low-frequency subband.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <wavelet2D.h>

\&...

mat mt = it_dwt2D(m, 5); /* perform a wavelet decomposition on 5 levels);
mat *subbands = it_wavelet2D_split(mt, 5); /* split the transformed matrix */
mat_zero(subbands[0]); /* clear the low pass band */
mt = it_wavelet2D_merge(mt, 5); /* merge the subbands to the transformed matrix */
m = it_idwt2D(mt, 5);     /* recompose the matrix 'm' */
