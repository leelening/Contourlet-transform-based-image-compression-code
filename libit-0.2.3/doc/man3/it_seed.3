.SH NAME
it_seed \- initialize the random number generator from a seed
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/random.h>
.sp
void it_seed ( unsigned int seed
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function initializes the random number generator using the seed specified in \fIseed\fR\&. A random number generator initialized with a given seed always produces the same sequence of numbers. Note that this function is unsecure (in the sense that it shouldn't be used in cryptographic applications) as the key space is limited to 32-bits.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
None
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <random.h>

\&...

double r;
it_randomize();
r = it_rand(); /* unknown value at each execution */
it_seed(0xdeadbeef);
r = it_rand(); /* always the same value at each execution */
