.SH NAME
imat_new_diag \- Creates a diagonal matrix from input vector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/mat.h>
.sp
imat imat_new_diag ( ivec v
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBimat_new_diag\fR creates a diagonal matrix from the parameter vector \fIv\fR\&. The returned matrix is a square matrix whose diagonal correspond to the elements of \fIv\fR\&. Note that the width and the heigth of the returned matrix are equal to the length of the vector \fIv\fR\&.   
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
New matrix with element of input vector on the diagonal
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <mat.h>

\&...

ivec v = ivec_new_string("1 2 3 4 5");   /* Vector [1 2 3 4 5 ]  */
imat m = imat_new_diag(v);               /* Matrix [[1 0 0 0 0]
