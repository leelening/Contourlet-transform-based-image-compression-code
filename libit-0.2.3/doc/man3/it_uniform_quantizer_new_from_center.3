.TH "IT_UNIFORM_QUANTIZER_NEW_FROM_CENTER" "3" "01 August 2006" "" ""

.SH NAME
it_uniform_quantizer_new_from_center \- create a uniform scalar quantizer from center
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/quantizer.h>
.sp
void it_uniform_quantizer_new_from_center ( double center, double step, double factor
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function creates a new uniform scalar quantizer object from the center of the  quantization codebook \fIcenter\fR (i.e. the reconstruction value corresponding to the symbol \fI0\fR) and the stepsize \fIstep\fR\&. The \fIfactor\fR arguments is used to create a dead-zone around the central reconstruction value, that is the bin for the \fI0\fR symbol is \fIfactor\fR times the size of the bin for other symbols. For classical uniform quantization it is set to 1.0, whereas dead-zone quantization usually refers to \fIfactor\fR=2.0.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"

.SH "EXAMPLE"

/* create a new uniform quantizer with step 1/256 centered on 0
   with a dead-zone of twice the step size                      */
