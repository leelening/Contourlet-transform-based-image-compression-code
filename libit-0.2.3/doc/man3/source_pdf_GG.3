.SH NAME
source_pdf_GG \- discrete GGD generator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/source_fit.h>
.sp
vec source_pdf_GG ( vec symbols, double alpha, double beta
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function generates an approximate of the generalized Gaussian distribution for a discrete source taking values in the \fIsymbols\fR alphabet. The \fIalpha\fR and \fIbeta\fR arguments are the parameters of the generalized Gaussian distribution, which is defined as GGD(x) = exp(-(|x| / \fIalpha\fR)**\fIbeta\fR).
