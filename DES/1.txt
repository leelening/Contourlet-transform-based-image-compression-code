I am now. Stefan didn't say it, but Elena knew it was what he was thinking. She could see it in the way 
he stared at her. She had never been so sure of her power. Except that actually he didn't look as if he 
were having a good time; he looked stricken, in pain, as if he couldn't take one more minute of this.
