.SH NAME
bvec_find_sorted \- find the position of a value in a sorted vector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/vec.h>
.sp
idx_t bvec_find_sorted ( bvec v, byte val
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Assuming that the vector is sorted, the function \fBbvec_find_sorted\fR returns a position in the vector \fIv\fR where the value \fIval\fR can be found. If the value \fIval\fR is not in the vector, the function returns the position where is should be inserted to maintain the vector sorted. In particular, is the value \fIval\fR is greater than any element of the vector, the function returns the length of the vector.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The position in the vector
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <vec.h>

\&...

bvec v = bvec_new_arithm (1,2,4);      /* v =[1,3,5,7]   */

idx_t pos = bvec_find_sorted (v, 5);   /* pos = 2 */          
pos = bvec_find_sorted (v, 4);         /* pos = 2 */    
pos = bvec_find_sorted (v, 0);         /* pos = 0 */    
pos = bvec_find_sorted (v, 15);        /* pos = 4 */
