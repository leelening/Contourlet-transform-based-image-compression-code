.SH NAME
bvec_ber \- bit error rate between two sequences
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/distance.h>
.sp
double bvec_ber ( bvec v1, bvec v2
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function computes the bit error rate (BER) between two binary sequences \fIv1\fR and \fIv2\fR\&. This corresponds to the Hamming distance between \fIv1\fR and \fIv2\fR divided by the length of \fIv1\fR, which is taken as the reference in case the vectors lengths do not match. 
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The bit error rate
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <distance.h>

\&...

bvec v1 = bvec_new_string("0 1 1 1 0 0");
bvec v2 = bvec_new_string("0 1 1 0 0 0");
/* compute the BER between v1 and v2 */
double ber = bvec_ber(v1, v2);
