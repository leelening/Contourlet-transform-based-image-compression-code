.SH NAME
ivec_new_perm \- generates an uniformly shuffled ivec
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/vec.h>
.sp
ivec ivec_new_perm ( size_t len, unsigned int seed
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBivec_new_perm\fR generates uniformly distributed permutations (or shuffles) using the Fisher-Yates algorithm. The newly created permutation has size \fIlen\fR and is generated initializing the PRNG with \fIseed\fR\&. It is basically the opposite of function \fBivec_qsort\fR\&. 
Reference: R.A. Fisher and F. Yates, Example 12, Statistical Tables, London, 1938. 
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
a pseudo-random uniformly-distributed permutation
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <vec.h>

\&...

ivec p = ivec_new_perm (5,1234);   /* p= [0 2 3 4 1] */ 
ivec_delete (p);
p = ivec_new_perm (5, 12345);      /* p= [4 0 2 3 1] */
