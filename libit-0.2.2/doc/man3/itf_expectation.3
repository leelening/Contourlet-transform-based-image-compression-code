.TH "ITF_EXPECTATION" "3" "01 August 2006" "" ""

.SH NAME
itf_expectation \- expectation operator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/math.h>
.sp
double itf_expectation ( double x, it_function_args(itf_expectation) *args
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBitf_expectation\fR returns the expectation of the an it_function \fBf\fR defined as the integral of t*f(t) over the interval. This is also sometimes called the first moment of the function \fBf\fR\&. The argument \fIx\fR corresponds to the upper bound of this integral.  The expectation of the function is approximated by computing the value of the function at various positions between \fIa\fR and \fIx\fR and using the Romberg method to compute a fast and accurate approximation. The expectation operator has the following parameters, passed through the \fIargs\fR argument.
.SS "FUNCTION PARAMETERS"
.TP
\fBa\fR
The lower bound of the integral.
.TP
\fBfunction\fR
The function on which to compute the expectation.
.TP
\fBargs\fR
The parameters of the function.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Not really applicable. See the example below.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
