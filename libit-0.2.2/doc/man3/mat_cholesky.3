.TH "MAT_CHOLESKY" "3" "01 August 2006" "" ""

.SH NAME
mat_cholesky \- performs in-place Cholesky decomposition
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/linalg.h>
.sp
void mat_cholesky ( mat A
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBmat_cholesky\fR performs in-place Cholesky decomposition of a symmetric positive-definite (spd) matrix. We do not check whether \fIA\fR is spd or not. Cholesky decomposition is similar to LU but returns a lower triangular matrix L such that A=LL^t.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
void
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <linalg.h>

\&...

mat a= mat_new (2,2); 

a[0][0] = 12.;   a[0][1] = 2.; 
a[1][0] = 2.;   a[1][1] = 11.; 

mat_cholesky( a ); /* a=[3.464 0.000 ; 0.577 3.266] */
