.SH NAME
vec_inner_product_robust \- robust computation of inner product
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/vec.h>
.sp
double vec_inner_product_robust ( vec v1, vec v2
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBvec_inner_product_robust\fR uses Kahan's method to compute robust inner product between the two input vectors \fIv1\fR and \fIv2\fR\&. These vectors must have the same length.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
robust inner product of the two input vectors
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <vec.h>

\&...

vec v1 = vec_new_string("-1 -2 1.5");        /* vector [ -1 -2 1.5 ]  */
vec v2 = vec_new_string("2 0 4");            /* vector [ 2 0 4 ]      */
double p = vec_inner_product_robust(v1, v2); /* p = 4                 */
