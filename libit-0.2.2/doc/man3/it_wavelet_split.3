.SH NAME
it_wavelet_split \- split the vector of wavelet coefficients
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/wavelet.h>
.sp
vec * it_wavelet_split ( vec wav, int nb_levels
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function splits the vector of wavelet coefficients \fIwav\fR to a set of subband vectors. The number of levels \fInb_level\fR must be given. The returned array of vectors is an array of \fInb_level\fR+1 vectors with the first vector representing the low-frequency subband.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <wavelet.h>

\&...

vec vt = it_dwt(v, 5); /* perform a wavelet decomposition on 5 levels);
vec *subbands = it_wavelet_split(vt, 5); /* split the transformed vector */
vec_zero(subbands[0]); /* clear the low pass band */
vt = it_wavelet_merge(vt, 5); /* merge the subbands to the transformed vector */
v = it_idwt(vt, 5);     /* recompose the vector 'v' */
