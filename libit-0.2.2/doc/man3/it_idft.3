.SH NAME
it_idft \- inverse discrete Fourier transform
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/fourier.h>
.sp
cvec it_idft ( cvec v
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function computes the inverse discrete Fourier transform of the complex vector \fIv\fR\&. The first element of this vector corresponds to the lowest frequency (DC value). If \fIv\fR is conjugate symmetric, that is if v[N-i] = v[i]*, where N is the length of \fIv\fR, the output will be a real vector (that is, all elements of the complex output vector will have a null imaginary part).  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The vector of the inverse discrete Fourier transform
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <fourier.h>

\&...

cvec vt = cvec_new_string("1 1+i 0 1-i");
/* reconstruct the vector using the inverse discrete Fourier transform */
cvec v = it_idft(vt);
