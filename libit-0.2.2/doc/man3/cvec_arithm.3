.sp
void cvec_arithm ( cvec, cplx start, cplx incr
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBcvec_arithm\fR sets the vector \fIv\fR so that the elements correspond to the arithmetic sequence of starting value \fIstart\fR, increasing by a step of \fIincr\fR\&. The length is kept unchanged.

None
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <vec.h>

\&...

cvec v = cvec_new(4);     /* creates the vector (not initialized) */
cvec_arithm(v,1,cplx_I);  /* set v to [1 1+i 1+2i 1+3i]           */
