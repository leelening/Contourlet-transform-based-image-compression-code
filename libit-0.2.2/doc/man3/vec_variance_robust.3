.SH NAME
vec_variance_robust \- robust computation of the variance of a vector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/vec.h>
.sp
double vec_variance_robust ( vec v
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBvec_variance_robust\fR uses Knuth's two-pass algorithm for robust computation of the variance of vector \fIv\fR\&. During the first pass, a robust estimate of the mean is computed. During the second pass, we apply Knuth's method on the residuals. Use it when desesperate or in case of numerically strange values. The estimate given by this function is known to behave gracefully even with numerically strange data.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The robust variance estimate of input vector
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <vec.h>

\&...

vec v = vec_new_string( "5 -2 2 4 1" );  /* Create a vector of 5 elements */
double d = vec_variance_robust( v );     /* d = 6                         */
