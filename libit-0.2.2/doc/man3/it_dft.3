.SH NAME
it_dft \- discrete Fourier transform
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/fourier.h>
.sp
cvec it_dft ( cvec v
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function computes the discrete Fourier transform of the complex vector \fIv\fR\&. The first element of the returned vector corresponds to the lowest frequency (DC value). For a complex vector \fIv\fR that is actually a real vector (i.e. when all elements of \fIv\fR have a null imaginary part), the output vector will be conjugate symmetric, that is V[N-i] = V[i]*, where V is the output vector of length N equal to the length of the input vector \fIv\fR\&.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The vector of discrete Fourier coefficients
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <fourier.h>

\&...

cvec v = cvec_new_string("1.0 4.0 1.0 -2.0");
/* analyse the vector using the discrete Fourier transform */
cvec vt = it_dft(v);
