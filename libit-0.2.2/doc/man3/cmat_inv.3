.SH NAME
cmat_inv \- computes inverse of complex matrix
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/linalg.h>
.sp
cmat cmat_inv ( cmat m
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBcmat_inv\fR is the complex-analogon for \fBmat_inv\fR, except that it: 
- returns a void matrix instead of NULL when \fIm\fR is singular
- does not use complex LU decomposition 
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
void matrix is input is matrix singular, complex inverse otherwise
