);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBbvec_arithm\fR sets the vector \fIv\fR so that the elements correspond to the arithmetic sequence of starting value \fIstart\fR, increasing by a step of \fIincr\fR\&. The length is kept unchanged.

.nf

#include <vec.h>

\&...

bvec v = bvec_new(5); /* creates the vector (not initialized) */
bvec_arithm(v,1,2);   /* set v to [1 3 5 7 9]                 */
