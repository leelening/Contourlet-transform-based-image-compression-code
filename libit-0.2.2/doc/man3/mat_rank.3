.SH NAME
mat_rank \- computes the rank of the input matrix
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/linalg.h>
.sp
int mat_rank ( mat A
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBmat_rank\fR returns the rank of the input matrix \fIA\fR\&. To do this, we of course perform a SVD.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
the rank of the input matrix
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <linalg.h>

\&...

m1 = mat_new( 3, 3 ); 
int r; 

m1[0][0] = 1;   m1[0][1] = 5;   m1[0][2] = 2; 
m1[1][0] = 2;   m1[1][1] = 3;   m1[1][2] = 5; 
m1[2][0] = 3;   m1[2][1] = 7;   m1[2][2] = 3; 

r = mat_rank (m1);     /* r = 3 */
