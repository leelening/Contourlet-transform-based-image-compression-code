.SH NAME
mat_to_vec \- vectorize a matrix into a vector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/mat.h>
.sp
vec mat_to_vec ( mat m
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBmat_to_vec\fR vectorizes the matrix \fIm\fR into a vector. In other terms, the resulting vector is the concatenation of all the rows of \fIm\fR\&. Its length is then the product of the width by the height of the matrix 'm '. Note that this function is the equivalent of the notation 'm(:)' in Matlab. 
.SH "RETURN VALUE"

The vector

mat m = mat_new_string ("[[1 2][4 3]]");  /* m = [[1 2]  
                                                  [4 3]    */

vec v = mat_to_vec (m);                   /* v = [1 2 4 3] */
