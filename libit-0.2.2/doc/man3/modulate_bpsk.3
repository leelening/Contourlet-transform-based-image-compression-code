.SH NAME
modulate_bpsk \- BPSK modulation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/channel.h>
.sp
vec modulate_bpsk ( bvec v
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function modulates the binary vector \fIv\fR to a real vector using binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation. The 0 bit is represented with the real value -1, whereas the 1 bit is represented with the real value +1. 
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The sequence of bits modulated
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <channel.h>

\&...

bvec message = bvec_new_string("0 1 1 0 0 0 1");

/* modulate the message using BPSK */
vec modulated = modulate_bpsk(output);
