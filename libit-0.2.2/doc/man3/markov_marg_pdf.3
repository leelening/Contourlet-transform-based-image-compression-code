.SH NAME
markov_marg_pdf \- stationary distribution of a Markov chain
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/source_func.h>
.sp
vec markov_marg_pdf ( mat pt
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function returns the stationary probability density function of a Markov chain defined by its transition matrix pt. It uses the Froebenius theorem stating that this p.d.f. is obtained from the normalized eigen vector of \fIpt\fR corresponing to the eigen value 1.
