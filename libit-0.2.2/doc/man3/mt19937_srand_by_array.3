.sp
void mt19937_srand_by_array ( unsigned int init_key[], unsigned int key_length
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function allows to initialize the MT19937 PRNG with an array of arbitrary length. \fIkey_length\fR is the size of the array. For people needing more than 32 bit seed space. 
Like all other functions having mt19937 in their names, they are intended to use advanced features of the MT19937 PRNG. 
See \fBmt19937_srand_by_array\fR\&.

unsigned int ar=[ 1 2 3 4 ];                      /* seed array */ 

mt19937_srand_by_array( ar, 4 );                  /* init PRNG with array */ 
mt19937_rand_int32();                             /* runs the PRNG */
