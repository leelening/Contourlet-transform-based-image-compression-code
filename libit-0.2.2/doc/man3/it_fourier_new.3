.SH NAME
it_fourier_new \- Fourier transform constructor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/fourier.h>
.sp
void * it_fourier_new ( void
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBit_fourier_new\fR function creates a new Fourier transform object. This object can later be used as an it_transform_t to perform discrete Fourier transform or inverse Fourier transform on a complex vector using the \fBit_transform\fR or \fBit_itransform\fR method respectively.
.PP
Creating this transform object and using the \fBit_transform\fR method is prefered to using \fBit_dft\fR when multiple transform on vectors of the same size are to be done. 
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The new fourier transform object
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <fourier.h>

\&...

it_fourier_t *fourier = it_fourier_new();
cvec v = cvec_new_string("[ 0.3 1.5 2.5 ]");
cvec vt;
vt = (cvec) it_transform(fourier, (Vec) v);
