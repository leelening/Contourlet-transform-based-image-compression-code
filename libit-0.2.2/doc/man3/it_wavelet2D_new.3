.SH NAME
it_wavelet2D_new \- separable 2D wavelet transform constructor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/wavelet2D.h>
.sp
void it_wavelet2D_new ( it_wavelet_lifting_t const *lifting, int level
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBit_wavelet2D_new\fR function creates a new separable 2D wavelet transform object on \fIlevel\fR levels using lifting steps \fIlifting\fR\&. This object can later be used as an it_transform2D_t to perform discrete wavelet transform or inverse wavelet transform on a real-valued matrix using the \fBit_transform2D\fR or \fBit_itransform2D\fR method respectively.
.PP
Creating this transform object and using the \fBit_transform2D\fR method is prefered to using \fBit_dwt2D\fR when multiple transform on matrices of the same size are to be done. 
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <wavelet2D.h>

\&...

it_wavelet_t *wavelet2D = it_wavelet2D_new(it_wavelet_lifting_97, 5);
mat m = mat_new_ones(100,100);
mat mt;
mt = (mat) it_transform2D(wavelet2D, (mat) m);
