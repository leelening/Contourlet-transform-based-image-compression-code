.TH "MAT_DISTANCE_NORM" "3" "01 August 2006" "" ""

.SH NAME
mat_distance_norm \- norm distance between two matrices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/distance.h>
.sp
double mat_distance_norm ( mat m1, mat m2, double norm
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function computes the distance between the two matrices \fIm1\fR and \fIm2\fR corresponding to the norm \fInorm\fR\&. This norm is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between elements of \fIm1\fR and the corresponding elements of \fIm2\fR raised to the power of \fInorm\fR\&.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The distance derived from the norm
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <distance.h>

\&...

mat m1 = mat_new(2,2);
mat m2 = mat_new(2,2);
m1[0][0] = 3.5;
m1[0][1] = 6.8;
m1[1][0] = 2.2;
m1[1][1] = 5.1;
m2[0][0] = 5.5;
m2[0][1] = 2.3;
m2[1][0] = 7.7;
m2[1][1] = 0.6;
/* compute the Euclidean distance between the two matrices */
double distance = mat_distance_norm(m1, m2, 2);
