.SH NAME
source_expectation \- compute the expectation of a discrete source
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/source_func.h>
.sp
double source_expectation ( vec pdf, vec symbols
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function returns the expectation of a discrete source represented its probability density function \fIpdf\fR and the value associated to each symbol, stored in \fIsymbols\fR\&.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"

.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <source_func.h>

\&...

vec pdf = vec_new_string("0.5 0.3 0.1 0.1"); /* probability density function */
vec rec = vec_new_string("-1 0 1.5 2.5");    /* values of the symbols        */
/* compute the expectation of the source */
double mean = source_expectation(pdf, rec);  /* -0.5 + 0.15 + 0.25 = -0.1    */
