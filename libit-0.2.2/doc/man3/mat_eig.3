.TH "MAT_EIG" "3" "01 August 2006" "" ""

.SH NAME
mat_eig \- computes eigen decomposition of the input matrix
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/linalg.h>
.sp
cvec mat_eig ( mat a, cmat evec
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBmat_eig\fR performs eigen-decomposition of a real matrix \fIa\fR\&. Eigenvectors are stored in \fIevec\fR\&. Be sure to make proper memory allocation beforehand. Eigenvalues are the output of the function.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
complex vector of eigenvalues
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <linalg.h>

\&...

mat m1 = mat_new( 3, 3 ); 
cmat evec = mat_new (3, 3); 
cvec eval; 

m1[0][0] = 1;   m1[0][1] = 5;   m1[0][2] = 2; 
m1[1][0] = 2;   m1[1][1] = 3;   m1[1][2] = 5; 
m1[2][0] = 3;   m1[2][1] = 7;   m1[2][2] = 3; 

eval = mat_eig ( m1, evec );
