.TH "MAT_COND" "3" "01 August 2006" "" ""

.SH NAME
mat_cond \- computes the condition number of the input matrix
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/linalg.h>
.sp
double mat_cond ( mat A
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBmat_cond\fR returns the condition number of the matrix \fIA\fR\&. Since it is the ratio between the two extremal singular values, we therefore proceed to a SVD beforehand.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
condition number of input matrix
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <linalg.h>

\&...

mat m1 = mat_new( 3, 3 ); 
double c; 

m1[0][0] = 1;   m1[0][1] = 5;   m1[0][2] = 2; 
m1[1][0] = 2;   m1[1][1] = 3;   m1[1][2] = 5; 
m1[2][0] = 3;   m1[2][1] = 7;   m1[2][2] = 3; 

c = mat_cond (m1);         /* c = 13.185340 */
