.sp
\fB#include <it/linalg.h>
.sp
vec mat_qr ( mat A
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBmat_qr\fR performs in-place QR decomposition of the matrix \fIA\fR\&. A matrix can be decomposed into A=QR where Q is square and orthogonal and R upper trapezoidal. We output the diagonal of matrix R.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
diagonal elements of matrix R
