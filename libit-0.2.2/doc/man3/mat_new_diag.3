.SH NAME
mat_new_diag \- Creates a diagonal matrix from input vector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/mat.h>
.sp
mat mat_new_diag ( vec v
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBmat_new_diag\fR creates a diagonal matrix from the parameter vector \fIv\fR\&. The returned matrix is a square matrix whose diagonal correspond to the elements of \fIv\fR\&. Note that the width and the heigth of the returned matrix are equal to the length of the vector \fIv\fR\&.   
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
New matrix with element of input vector on the diagonal
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <mat.h>

\&...

vec v = vec_new (2); 
mat m; 

v[0] = 2; v[1] = 3; 

m = mat_new_diag (v); 

/*
m = 
[[ 2   0 ]
 [ 0   3 ]]
*/
