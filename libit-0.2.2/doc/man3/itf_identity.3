.TH "ITF_IDENTITY" "3" "01 August 2006" "" ""

.SH NAME
itf_identity \- the identity function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/math.h>
.sp
double itf_identity ( double x, void *args
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBitf_identity\fR function is a very simple it_function which returns the value of the argument \fIx\fR\&. It does not have any parameters, therefore, when called directly, \fIargs\fR should be set to NULL. 
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The same value as 'x'
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <math.h>

\&...

/* this simply returns 2.0 and assign it to x */
double x = itf_identity(2.0, NULL);

/* create the function x->x^2 by multiplying two identity functions */
it_function_args(itf_mul) mul_args;

/* multiply the identity function with itself */
mul_args.f = itf_identity;
mul_args.f_args = NULL;
mul_args.g = itf_identity;
mul_args.g_args = NULL;

/* compute the value of the product in 1.0 */
itf_mul(1.0, &mul_args);
