.SH NAME
channel_bsc \- BSC channel simulation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/channel.h>
.sp
bvec channel_bsc ( bvec v, double crossover_proba
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function simulates the transmission of a binary vector \fIv\fR over an binary symmetric channel (BSC). The cross-over probability of this channel is given by the \fIcrossover_proba\fR argument.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The noisy sequence of bits
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <channel.h>

\&...

bvec message = bvec_new_string("0 1 1 0 0 0 1");

/* send over a BSC channel of cross-over probability 0.1 */ 
bvec received = channel_bsc(message, 0.1);
