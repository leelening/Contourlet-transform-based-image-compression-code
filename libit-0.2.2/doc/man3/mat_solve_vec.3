.TH "MAT_SOLVE_VEC" "3" "01 August 2006" "" ""

.SH NAME
mat_solve_vec \- returns x such that Ax=b
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/linalg.h>
.sp
vec mat_solve_vec ( mat A, vec b
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function uses LU decomposition to solve Ax=b. It performs dimensions check before proceeding. Matrix \fIA\fR must be square. LU decomposition takes O(n^3) time. 
See \fBmat_solve_mat\fR\&.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
vector x such that Ax=b
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <linalg.h>

\&...

mat a = mat_new( 2, 2 ); 
vec b = vec_new( 2 ); 

a[0][0] = 1; a[0][1] = 3; 
a[1][0] = 5; a[1][1] = 3; 

b[0] = 3; 
b[1] = 1; 

vec x = mat_solve_vec( a, b ); /* x = [-.5 ; 1.666666667] */
