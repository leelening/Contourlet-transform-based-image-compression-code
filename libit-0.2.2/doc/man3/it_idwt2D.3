.SH NAME
it_idwt2D \- inverse separable 2D discrete wavelet transform
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/wavelet2D.h>
.sp
mat it_idwt2D ( mat t, it_wavelet_lifting_t const *lifting, int levels
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function computes the inverse discrete wavelet transform of \fImt\fR using the lifting steps described by \fIlifting\fR\&. The input matrix of coefficients \fImt\fR is the concatenation of all the coefficients in each subbands starting from the low-frequency subband. Currently the lifting steps for the usual 5/3 and 9/7 biorthogonal filters are predefined as "it_wavelet_lifting_53" and "it_wavelet_lifting_97", although you can provide your own lifting steps.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The set of inverse wavelet coefficients
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <wavelet2D.h>

\&...

/* analyse a signal 'm' using a 5-level 9/7 wavelet decomposition */
mat mt = it_dwt2D(m, it_wavelet_lifting_97, 5);
/* recompose the signal by inverse transform */
mat mr = it_idwt2D(mt, it_wavelet_lifting_97, 5);
