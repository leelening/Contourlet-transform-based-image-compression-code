.TH "MAT_NORM2" "3" "01 August 2006" "" ""

.SH NAME
mat_norm2 \- computes the 2-norm of the input matrix
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/linalg.h>
.sp
double mat_norm2 ( mat A
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function \fBmat_norm2\fR returns the 2-norm of matrix \fIA\fR\&. Since it is the value of the largest singular value, we proceed to a SVD.  
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
2-norm of input matrix
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

#include <linalg.h>

\&...

mat m1 = mat_new( 3, 3 ); 
double n2; 

m1[0][0] = 1;   m1[0][1] = 5;   m1[0][2] = 2; 
m1[1][0] = 2;   m1[1][1] = 3;   m1[1][2] = 5; 
m1[2][0] = 3;   m1[2][1] = 7;   m1[2][2] = 3; 

n2 = mat_norm2 (m1);      /* n2 = 11.176343 */
