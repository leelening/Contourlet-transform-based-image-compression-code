  Linear algebra functions
  Copyright (C) 2006 François Cayre


  These basic linear algebra functions are meant as a good 
  Swiss knife for every day use in most situations (real, 
  dense matrices). 

  We do not plan to add support for sparse, banded matrices 
  or whatsoever. 

  GENERAL NOTE: Several functions provided here imply using 
  several additionnal storage for various matrices or vectors 
  related to the goal of the function (think of matrices U 
  *and* V of a SVD for exmaple). IN THESE CASES, IT IS THE 
  RESPONSIBILITY OF THE USER TO PROPERLY ALLOCATE MEMORY BEFORE 
  CALLING THE ROUTINE. However, we gracefully perform checking 
  before actually launching the routine. 

  Functions: 
  - mat_eig_sym    [ It is the responsibility of the user to make ]
  - mat_eig_nonsym [ a proper decision between these two routines ]
  - mat_svd 
  - mat_rank 
  
  are taken from the public-domain JAMA package: 
  http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/ 

  Original code from: 
  - Joe Hicklin         (MathWorks)
  - Cleve Moler         (MathWorks)
  - Peter Webb          (MathWorks)
  - Ronald F. Boisvert  (NIST)
  - Bruce Miller        (NIST)
  - Roldan Pozo         (NIST)
  - Karin Remington     (NIST)

  According to the JAMA page: 
  "The algorithms employed are similar to those of the 
   classic Wilkinson and Reinsch Handbook, i.e. the same 
   algorithms used in EISPACK, LINPACK and MATLAB."

  The linear system solver is based on LU with partial or 
  total pivoting strategy (choice is left to the user). 

  TODO (possibly before 2048): 
  - Least square QR solver (possibly constrained) 
  - Implementation of various Arnoldi/Lanczos-based methods
